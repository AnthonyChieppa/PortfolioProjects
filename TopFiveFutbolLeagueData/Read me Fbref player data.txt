Project Overview:
This project builds a comprehensive visual dashboard for analyzing player performance across the top five European football leagues. The process includes scraping, preprocessing, structured querying, and advanced visualization.

Workflow Summary:

1. Data Collection:
   - Source: FBref player statistics pages
   - Scope: Top five leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1)
   - Method: Python web scraping using BeautifulSoup to extract HTML tables

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation:
   - Parsed raw HTML into structured pandas DataFrames
   - Cleaned columns, removed null entries, standardized metrics
   - Exported cleaned datasets into CSV format for storage

3. SQL Integration:
   - Imported CSVs into SQL tables (e.g., forwards_table, defenders_table)
   - Built position-specific queries tailored for performance comparison and filtering

4. Visualization Prep:
   - Queried subsets of players by position (FWD, MID, DEF, GK)
   - Exported query results into visualization-ready CSVs

5. Tableau Dashboards:
   - Created dynamic stats pages for each position: Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper
   - Built radar charts to visualize percentile-based metrics and player comparisons
   - Integrated parameters to allow user-controlled selection and dual-player comparisons

Features:
- Percentile-based radar charts per position
- Dynamic player comparison using parameter controls
- Clean positional summaries including nation, age, and minutes played
- Modular workflow allowing updates with new seasonal data
